Our project aims to research hate speech on social networks (Twitter) for Portuguese and Spanish, directed against journalists and environmental activists. We want to create training and validation databases, find hierarchical keywords and themes, to create models that can validate or not hate speech in these categories. And for better understanding we intend to use topic modeling and graph network visualization
